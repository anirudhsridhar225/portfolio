there are *so many* reasons that i honestly don't know where to start

## designing this portfolio

designing this portfolio was genuinely the biggest pain in my ass for the longest time. i cannot emphasize on how impossibly difficult it seemed because of the hundreds of clashing ideas in my head. hell im fairly certain at one point this very portfolio website repository had 3 branches that had 3 different tech stacks with 3 different designs all competing for which one gets more attention from me (which was a huge disaster that ended giving no attention to any one of them).

## the adhd brain

everytime i look at another *cool* portfolio on the internet (yes i do that like i do window shopping, yes im weird like that) i feel like i want to integrate this new cool feature or that really nice implementation. 

i also wanted to make my portfolio my personal testing grounds for whatever new frameworks or technologies i wanted to try using, but didn't have any proper project ideas for. This resulted in a, um, little bit of a mess let's just say.

the mess being the following SEPERATE iterations:
1. sveltekit
2. nuxt/vue
3. angular
4. htmx and go
5. next
6. pure html
7. a drogon (c++) based backend at one point before
8. astro (which is where we are at, right now)

## why and how did i finally lock in?

well, as time passes and you apply for more `*nternships` and `j*bs` and freelance projects, you get demanded to show some proof of work. and the best way to do, unironically, is to have a portfolio website. why you ask? because a portfolio website is a much more digestible way to put your resume across to an `*mployer` and it can also serve as an indicator of your skills.

but this is an astro theme though you might ask? well in my particular peculiar scenario, im just horrible at designing and when it comes to something as abstract as a portfolio my brain will always want to try new things out and things keep getting bogged down that way.

sooooo, i just decided to use a theme and get it over with. at least now i can just tell people to go to `anirudh.foo` if they ever want to see my credentials (and shitposts).
